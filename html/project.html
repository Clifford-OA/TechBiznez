      			<p> The project focuses on aquaculture fish farming as a sustainable way of raising funds to promote education (SDG 4) as it is estimated that 60% of the fish, we eat in Ghana is imported. </p>
      			<p>Following the high cost of educational materials which has made it virtually impossible for most families to afford quality education, the FISH.ME.2. SCHOOL project seeks to promote quality education by supplying on regular basis educational materials to the education sector and school children in deprived comunities.</p>
      			<p>We have supplied and distributed over 10,000 educational materials in deprived communities within three regions (Northern region, Ashanti region and the Eastern region) in Ghana. </p>
      			<p>Through the FISH.ME.2. SCHOOL project, we have created sustainable jobs for women and inhabitants of communities as the demand for fish consumption in Ghana is continuously on the increase to finance the operations of W3. The project has also created jobs for women with primary or no education at all by employing them at the aquaculture farms. </p>
